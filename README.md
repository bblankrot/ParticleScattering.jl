A Julia package for solving large-scale electromagnetic
scattering problems in two dimensions; specifically,
those containing a large number of penetrable smooth
particles. Provides the ability to optimize over the
particle parameters for various design problems.

# Installation

Currently, only Julia 0.6 is supported, and the package must be installed
manually. See directions at [the official Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/#Installing-Unregistered-Packages-1).

### Community

The easiest way to contribute is by opening issues! Of course, we'd be more than happy if you implement any fixes and send a PR. If you have any relevant scattering problems that would make good examples for the docs, feel free to open an issue for that as well.
