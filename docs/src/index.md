# ParticleScattering.jl

A Julia package for solving large-scale electromagnetic
scattering problems in two dimensions; specifically,
those containing a large number of penetrable smooth
particles. Provides the ability to optimize over the
particle parameters for various design problems.

# Installation

Currently, only Julia 0.6 is supported. Once that's up and running,
`Pkg.add("ParticleScattering")` should install this package and all of its
dependencies.
