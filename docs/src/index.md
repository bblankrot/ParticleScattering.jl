# ParticleScattering

ParticleScattering is a package for solving large-scale electromagnetic
scattering problems in two dimensions. Because the solution process is so fast
for large numbers of penetrable scatterers, it also has built-in gradient-based
optimization over the scatterer parameters.

# Installation

Currently, only Julia 0.6 is supported. Once that's up and running, `Pkg.add("ParticleScattering")` should install this package and all of its
dependencies.
